## Linear Perspective - Overview and Misconceptions

Linear Perspective is a way of mapping a single view of a 3D scene onto a flat surface, like a piece of paper or a drawing tablet. It's meant to roughly translate to how we see the world and judging by its popularity in art, I would say it's been very successful! The "Linear" part refers to how it's built up using Straight Lines. If a line is straight in 3D space, it's going to be straight in Linear Perspective too. Makes sense!

It's useful when talking about Perspective to be able to break things into 2 separate spaces as what you draw is not itself a 3D space, but a projection of it. I may frequently refer to 3D space as being the world we are depicting, as well as the "Picture Plane" as the flat surface where our drawing actually exists.

- 3D Space vs Picture Plane Diagram, This will probably be its own section entirely later.

Linear perspective is often broken down into 3 separate forms. 1 Point, 2 Point and 3 Point perspective.
Each of these denotes how many Vanishing Points are used in the guides of the image.

Learning Linear Perspective initially as 3 different forms is however likely to do more damage than good as they are all *exactly the same thing.*

If we take a basic scene of a cube drawn with one vanishing point in the center of the frame, this would typically be referred to as 1 point perspective. There is a single vanishing point and the horizontal and vertical lines of the cube are parallel to each other.
But by rotating the cube 45 degrees we reveal that the horizontal lines were in fact also pointing towards a vanishing point.

- 1 Point Cube. Emphasis on single vanishing point. Rotates to 2 point cube. Emphasis on 2 vanishing points.

This vanishing point is so far away from the frame, infinitely far away even, that we don't realise it's even there and the lines become parallel with the horizon.

- 2 point rotates to 1 point. Emphasis on Horizontal and Vertical lines

The same is true in the opposite direction and for rotating vertically and in fact turning the cube all the way around makes it clear that every direction parallel lines go, they always meet at a Vanishing point. 

- Lots of Cube rotating animation

So... how many vanishing points are there? 1, 2, 3, 6? There's actually no limit!
Well, for a regular cube there's 6, but since there's no way in Linear Perspective for you to see more than 3 at a time, 3 Point Perspective ended up being considered the "most difficult form of perspective" for many.
I'll warn you now and say things get a lot more complicated than 3 point linear perspective... but that's only because 3 point perspective isn't nearly as hard as some people like to tell you!
